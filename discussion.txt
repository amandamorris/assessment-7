Recursion
1. In your own words, what is recursion?
Recursion is a computer science technique where a function calls itself.
It's often used instead of loops.
2. Why is it necessary to have a base case?
A base case is necessary so that the recursive calls end at some point.  If
there was no base case, the function would continue calling itself (until the
computer errors out).

Graphs
1. What is a graph?
A graph is a set of nodes and edges, and where the nodes show connections
between the edges.  Graphs can be directed or not directed.
2. How is a graph different from a tree?
All trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees.  Graphs can have cycles in
them, but trees cannot.
3. Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
Social networks are good to model with graphs - there may be cycles, and two
social circles may not overlap at all.
